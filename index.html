        <h2>Community Bonding Period</h2>
        <p>During the Community Bonding period, I familiarized myself with the FOSSASIA community, the Eventyay-Video platform, and the broader Eventyay ecosystem, including Eventyay-Talk and Eventyay-Tickets. This period allowed me to deepen my understanding of the project’s goals, the technical stack, and FOSSASIA's collaborative processes. I took several key steps to prepare for my work effectively:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meetings with Mentors:</strong> I held introductory meetings with my mentors to discuss the project’s scope, technical expectations, and the initial project roadmap. These sessions helped clarify my role and the skills I needed to focus on.</li>
            <li><strong>Project Documentation:</strong> I reviewed existing documentation and source code for Eventyay-Video, Eventyay-Talk, and Eventyay-Tickets to understand the platform’s architecture and identify areas where my contributions would have the most impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Contribution Workflow:</strong> I became familiar with FOSSASIA's contribution workflow, including code standards, Git practices, and communication channels. This enabled me to efficiently integrate my work with the existing codebase and collaborate seamlessly with other contributors.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Interaction:</strong> I actively participated in FOSSASIA community discussions, attending virtual meetups, and engaging with other contributors on FOSSASIA’s chat channels. This helped me understand user needs and gain insights into potential improvements to the platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This bonding period was essential for building a strong foundation for the project. It allowed me to align with the community’s values and goals, and provided the knowledge I needed to start coding with confidence.</p>
